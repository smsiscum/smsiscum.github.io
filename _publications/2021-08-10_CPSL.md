Apart from innovators and early adopters, industrial manufacturers are still looking for adequate guidance for the orientation, prioritization, and development of Industrie 4.0 initiatives. Case studies of best practices have proven beneficial for the identification of use cases in manufacturing companies. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to develop an orientation guide for Industrie 4.0 with best practice use cases structured into thematic categories of production system areas. The orientation guide gathers relevant use cases for the adaption in industrial implementations. As a first practical application, the guide will be rolled out in an international study to primarily support regional manufacturing companies from Germany in the development of own Industrie 4.0 use cases. However, the guide is universally applicable to any manufacturing company and provides useful insights for the implementation of Industrie 4.0 use cases globally.
