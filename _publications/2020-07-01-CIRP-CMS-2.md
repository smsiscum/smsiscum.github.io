Driven by digital transformation, manufacturing systems are heading towards autonomy. The implementation of autonomous elements in manufacturing systems is still a big challenge. Especially small and medium sized enterprises (SME) often lack experience to assess the degree of Autonomous Production. Therefore, a description model for the assessment of stages for Autonomous Production has been identified as a core element to support such a transformation process. In contrast to existing models, the developed SME-tailored model comprises different levels within a manufacturing system, from single manufacturing cells to the factory level. Furthermore, the model has been validated in several case studies.
