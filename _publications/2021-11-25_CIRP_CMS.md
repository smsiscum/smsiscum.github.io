Lean Production Systems (LPS) comprise an enterprise-specific set of goals and principles in combination with methods and tools for the holistic management of production processes. Recent studies imply that the digital transformation is creating new challenges for LPS, especially on the level of methods and tools. Therefore, this paper extends the existing research by a systematic literature review, examining contributions on the main five levels of LPS with regard to digital transformation. The results give quantified findings of latest research contributions on Lean Production Systems 4.0, where tools and processes are identified as being strongly influenced by digital transformation.
