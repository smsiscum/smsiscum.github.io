The Future Work Lab is an innovation lab for work, people and technology in Stuttgart, Germany with a focus on artificial intelligence and interconnected work organisation. A key component consists of the framework for cognitive production work 4.0, which will serve as a reference model for the research topics. A corresponding concept was developed in an interdisciplinary project team. In this article the raw model is introduced and the further research agenda is presented.
