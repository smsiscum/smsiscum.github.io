With digital transformation changing industrial labor drastically, the aim of this paper is to conceptualize a new methodical framework for the production system of the future. For this, mega trends for the industrial work of the future are considered. Existing concepts and tools for production systems are analyzed with regard to the identified challenges of digitalization and future work. The result of this paper is an academically relevant and practically applicable approach for the development of a framework for the digital transformation of the production system. The approach consists of a development process and eleven design principles. The theoretical developments are accompanied by practical applications within the environment of the “Future Work Lab”, an innovation lab for technical, social and organizational changes in industrial labor.
