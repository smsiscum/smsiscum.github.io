Lean Production Systems are enterprise-specific, methodical frame-works for the continuous orientation of all enterprise processes to the customer in order to achieve overall objectives. Due to the increasing complexity of digital transformation, the management of methods in Lean Production Systems 4.0 (LPS 4.0) is a challenging task for industrial engineering practice. Starting with a set of 35 Lean methods, this paper aim to review the existing literature regard-ing digitally-advanced LPS 4.0 methods. Academic contributions were analyzed in a systematic literature review (SLR). The SLR screening of 706 scientific pa-pers led to the identification of 54 approaches for LPS 4.0 methods. All 54 ap-proaches were assessed regarding their maturity level for detailed documentation. As a result, 18 LPS 4.0 methods are described in a uniform standardized LPS 4.0 method template. The new LPS 4.0 methods are highly relevant for practical ap-plication in industrial engineering practice, which has already been tested in a first implementation of methods in an industrial engineering toolbox (Toolbox Lean 4.0).
