Industrie 4.0 strives towards autonomous production based on interconnectedness and integration as well as cyber-physical and autonomous systems. An existing technology-independent stage model for autonomous production is extended by the systematic identification of technologies through a generally applicable methodological approach. Technologies are identified by means of technology profiles and concept maps for thematic characteristic fields and classified by a technology radar. In addition, the paper uncovers technological development fields for autonomous production and highlights further research needs.
