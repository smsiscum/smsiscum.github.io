Lean Production Systems (LPS) are established in industrial production and are typically based on the Toyota Production System in terms of their structure and elements. The Digital Transformation is influencing LPS, leading to emerging Lean Production Systems 4.0 (LPS 4.0). A central element of LPS are their design principles, which act as a link between the strategic level (corporate objectives) and operationally implementable level (methods and tools) in LPS. Part of the influence of Digital Transformation on LPS is adding new Industrie 4.0 design principles. While various scientific publications deal with the derivation and categorization of Industrie 4.0 design principles, there is no consensus on which design principles should be included in contemporary LPS 4.0. This paper describes the first step in addressing this overarching issue by systematically analyzing widely cited categorizations of Industrie 4.0 design principles. The approach of this paper is based on relating the Industrie 4.0 design principles to use cases that reflect the operative implementation of Industrie 4.0. This leads to transparency displaying which Industrie 4.0 design principles represent best the current Industrie 4.0 implementation activities.
