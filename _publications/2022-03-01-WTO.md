Lean Production Systems 4.0 (LPS 4.0) cause increased complexity in the management of methods and tools for industrial engineering. As a systematic approach for the operational part of LPS 4.0, this paper presents a catalogue for the management of methods and tools. This toolbox Lean 4.0 is prototypically implemented and includes many hundred elements from relevant sources and results in a structured system for industrial engineering practice.
