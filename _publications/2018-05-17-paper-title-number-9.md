This paper describes a conceptual methodology based on innovation in future workplaces within the smart factory, through adopting a quintuple helix open innovation model. Within this framework, the societal and economic challenges are seen as drivers for innovation, hence identifying opportunities for the knowledge economy. This methodology is utilised within the “Future Work Lab” project to turn it into a living lab for the transformation towards the digital factory of the future that tackles the identified challenges. The methodology supports the development of a balanced view between sociology, knowledge and innovation, creating collaborations between academia, economy and society.
