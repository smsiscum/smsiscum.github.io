On May 18-19, Fraunhofer IPA was the host of the closing event of Lernreise Industrie 4.0 live. The format is organized by the company macils and brings together more than 100 executives from German, Austrian and Swiss industrial companies for the exchange on Industrie 4.0 and deep-dive workshops. Bosch and Fraunhofer are leading partners of the Lernreise Industrie 4.0 live. After two years of various meetings, this event was the final highlight. In contrast to other years and due to the pandemic, the event had to be streamed from a meeting room turned into a TV studio. I contributed with a pitch and a workshop on lean production systems 4.0 as well as with various use cases broadcasted live from the Future Work Lab by my colleagues.
