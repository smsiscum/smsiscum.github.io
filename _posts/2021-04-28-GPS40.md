In Summer 2020, we have launched our two-staged study on the digital transformation of lean production systems with German industrial manufacturers. The first stage was an online survey with over 70 participants. For a detailed analysis of scientific hypotheses, the second stage of the study is set up with 18 expert interviews with professionals from leading German manufacturers such as Volkswagen, Audi, Siemens, Bosch, and Schaeffler until December 2020. The study was published in April 2021 by Fraunhofer IPA and is partly financed by the Future Work Lab project.
